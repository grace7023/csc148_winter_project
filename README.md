Intelligent computer component for two player games

How to play:
1. Run `game_interface.py`.
2. Select interactive strategy to play as yourself for player 1 (or any of the other strategies, if you'd like).
3. To play against a computer oponent, choose the rought outcome strategy, recursive strategy, or iterative strategy.
    * rough outcome strategy: A move based on what the next game state would be.
    * recursive strategy: Returns a move that maximizes the chances of winning. This function is recursive.
    * iterative strategy: Same as above, but coded iteratively.
4. Play!
